# 🚀 Continuous Learning Pipeline Guide

## Overview
The Continuous Learning Pipeline automatically processes large datasets and continuously improves your AI agent's capabilities. It learns from real-world data, adapts its models, and becomes more intelligent over time.

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. **Automatic Dataset Discovery**
- Scans configured directories for datasets (CSV, JSON, Excel, Parquet)
- Processes all available data automatically
- Supports multiple data directories

### 2. **Intelligent Learning**
- AI agent analyzes each dataset for quality issues
- Applies automatic corrections when possible
- Learns from successful and failed operations
- Adapts correction strategies based on real-world patterns

### 3. **Model Improvement**
- Retrains ML models with new data every 10 datasets
- Tracks performance improvements over time
- Saves enhanced models automatically
- Generates detailed learning reports

## 📊 Test Results from Your Real Data

**Successfully Processed:**
- ✅ **University Rankings**: 1,501 rows, 3 issues detected, 3 corrections applied

## 🛠️ Usage Options

### Option 1: Single Learning Session
```bash
# Process all datasets in one session
python continuous_learning_pipeline.py --mode single

# Process only first 5 datasets
python continuous_learning_pipeline.py --mode single --max-datasets 5

# Use specific data directories
python continuous_learning_pipeline.py --mode single --data-dirs "C:\Users\Wajid\Desktop\data" "data"
```

### Option 2: Continuous Learning (Recommended)
```bash
# Run continuous learning every 6 hours
python continuous_learning_pipeline.py --mode continuous --interval 6

# Run continuous learning every 12 hours
python continuous_learning_pipeline.py --mode continuous --interval 12
```

### Option 3: Quick Test
```bash
# Test with your real data
python test_continuous_learning.py
```

- Enhanced handling of complex data structures
- Improved transformation suggestions

### Long Term (3+ months)
- 80-90% accuracy on most data types
- Near-human level data quality assessment
- Predictive error prevention

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Dependencies**: Install `openpyxl` for Excel files
2. **Large Files**: Use Git LFS for model files > 50MB
3. **Memory Issues**: Reduce `max_workers` for large datasets

### Performance Tips
- Use SSD storage for faster processing
- Increase RAM for large datasets
- Run during low system usage periods

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Set data directories
export DATA_DIRECTORIES="data,demo_data,C:\Users\Wajid\Desktop\data"

# Set learning interval (hours)
export LEARNING_INTERVAL=6

# Set max workers for parallel processing
export MAX_WORKERS=4
```
